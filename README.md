# GeoLock: Geo Locke

## About
This is a sample application using geolocation and local storage APIs of HTML5
for three day pair programming camp at the University of Tokyo.
Clients retrieve a list of points from the server and store the list of points
where they have already visited.
I intended to develop a kind of treasure hunting games from this template.

Note that the administration pages such as /points/new etc.
are not secured for simplicity.
